6. WatchSwap at the Airbnb,"Five coworkersCarlos, Priya, Zoe, Marcus, and Danareturn to their Airbnb apartment in a coastal town after dining out. Carlos heads immediately upstairs to change clothes. Priya, Zoe, and Marcus watch Dana set an expensive vintage watch into a ceramic dish by the entryway. Thus, everyone except Carlos knows the watch is in the dish. After Carlos comes back downstairs, he and Marcus leave to pick up coffee for everyone. While they are gone, Zoe takes the watch from the dish and places it in a glass display shelf in the lounge. Priya secretly observes Zoe from the hallway, but Zoe believes Priya is busy in another room and doesn't notice her watching. Dana then calls Priya to help prepare some snacks in the kitchen, and Priya leaves, missing what happens next.

13. Lantern Logic & MetaBelief Impossibility,"At the renowned Beijing Opera House, performers are rehearsing the evening's performance of ""Legend of the White Snake."" Li Wei, portraying Xu Xian, is discussing a challenging martial arts scene with Chen Yu (portraying Fa Hai) when they observe new lantern decorations being hung on stage. Their colleague, Jia Lin (portraying Bai Suzhen), has personally designed and added intricate lotus patterns to these lanterns, which were not part of the original staging plan. Another performer, Ming Tao (portraying Xiao Qing), is delayed and has not yet arrived for rehearsal.

Li Wei briefly leaves to adjust his elaborate costume. Meanwhile, Chen Yu examines Jia Lin's new lantern arrangements closely. Concerned about safety for the acrobatic routines, Chen Yu subtly rearranges several lanterns. Jia Lin notices Chen Yu's actions through a backstage mirror but pretends she hasn't seen, assuming Chen Yu's actions reflect the director's orders, though Chen Yu is acting solely out of safety concerns.

Worried about Chen Yu's changes, Jia Lin quietly returns some lanterns to their original positions while adding hidden safety reinforcements invisible to the audience. She makes these adjustments while Chen Yu practices elsewhere. To avoid any conflict, Jia Lin then replaces some of the original lanterns entirely with stronger, identical-looking replicas. Neither Li Wei nor Chen Yu observes these final changes.

When Ming Tao finally arrives, he overhears Jia Lin inform Li Wei, ""I saw Chen Yu moving the lanterns around. She probably thinks they're still arranged according to the original design.""
