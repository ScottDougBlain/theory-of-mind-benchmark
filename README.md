# Theory of Mind Benchmark for LLMs

A comprehensive Theory of Mind evaluation suite for Large Language Models based on clinical psychology research. This benchmark translates gold-standard psychological assessments into AI safety evaluations, enabling systematic evaluation of mentalizing capabilities and comparison to clinical population baselines.

## Overview

Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to understand that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions different from one's own - is fundamental to social cognition and crucial for AI safety. This benchmark provides systematic evaluation of LLM mentalizing capabilities using psychology-inspired scenarios.

### Features

- 83 test scenarios covering multiple ToM domains
- Clinical psychology-informed question design
- Multi-API support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face)
- Capability emergence analysis across model scales
- Interactive visualization dashboard
- Systematic error pattern detection

## üìä Benchmark Structure

### Question Types

- **False Belief (FB)**: Classic false-belief task variations
- **Social Reasoning (SOC)**: Complex social inference scenarios
- **Pluralistic Ignorance (PI)**: Understanding when others hide true beliefs
- **Intentionality (INT)**: Goal and intention attribution
- **Emotion Recognition (EMO)**: Affective state inference
- **Sarcasm/Irony Detection (SAR/IRO)**: Non-literal language understanding

### Clinical Psychology Inspiration

The benchmark scenarios are inspired by research on Theory of Mind assessment in clinical populations, including studies of neurotypical controls, autism spectrum individuals, and cognitive impairment. Note that direct performance comparisons require careful interpretation due to methodological differences between clinical assessments and LLM evaluations.

### Difficulty Levels

- Easy: Basic false-belief tasks, direct social inference
- Medium: Multi-step reasoning, implicit mental states
- Hard: Complex social dynamics, nested beliefs

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash

## Methodology

### Question Format

Each ToM scenario follows a standardized structure:

```
**Scenario:**
[Detailed social situation with mental state information]

**Question:**
[Specific query about beliefs, intentions, or social dynamics]

**Options:**
A. [Response option 1]
B. [Response option 2]
C. [Response option 3]
D. [Response option 4]
E. [Response option 5]
```

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Overall Accuracy**: Percentage of correct responses across all questions
- **Type-Specific Accuracy**: Performance breakdown by ToM question type
- **Difficulty Analysis**: Accuracy distribution across easy/medium/hard questions
- **Clinical Comparison**: Performance difference vs. clinical population baselines
- **Error Pattern Analysis**: Systematic failure mode identification

### Scoring System

Models are evaluated on:
1. **Answer Accuracy**: Correct multiple-choice selection
2. **Reasoning Quality**: Coherence of explanation (future enhancement)
3. **Response Consistency**: Reliability across similar scenarios
4. **Clinical Calibration**: Alignment with human population data

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### `TheoryOfMindBenchmark`
